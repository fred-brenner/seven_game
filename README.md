# Seven game

Looking for an activation task to help improve concentration and performance in a group?

Consider trying out the Seven game!

## Rules:
The rules are simple:
starting with the moderator, everyone counts upwards.

However, instead of saying a multiple of "seven", players must clap their hands (e.g., 7, 14, 21, ...).

And instead of saying a multiple of "five", players must stand up (e.g., 5, 10, 15, ...).

The game ends when everyone in the group is standing.

## Script usage:
Keep track of how many iterations it takes for all players to stand.
  
## Give the Seven game a try and see how it can help energize and focus your group!
